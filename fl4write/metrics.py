"""Acceptance metrics — track whether posted findings get addressed.

The Greptile lesson: 79% nits = 19% address rate. Without measuring address
rate, we're flying blind on quality.

Audit 2026-09-01: the previous implementation counted ✅/"Addressed"
substrings in our own comment body — strings the renderer never emitted, so
the metric was structurally 0% forever while README advertised it. Real
signals now, derived from the persistent comment itself:

- `findings` — findings in the CURRENT comment (parsed via the renderer's
  finding-line contract).
- `resolved` — prior findings that no longer appear (the renderer's ✅
  Resolved section; recomputed here from the same contract).
- `reactions` — 👍/🎉 on our persistent comment = acknowledged.

`acceptance_snapshot` aggregates across open PRs with one: {addressed,
total, rate}. PRs without our comment are excluded from the denominator.
