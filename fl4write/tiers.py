"""Tier scheduler — the soft-launch scale answer, Phase 1 (consensus-gated,
fl4write #6: Architect APPROVE + Critic APPROVE-with-4-amendments).

DESIGN LAWS (from the gate):
- DERIVED-ONLY: reads state files + two forge probes; NEVER writes anything
  (LEARNINGS #17 — no second load/save pair). The engine stays untouched.
- FAIL-SAFE classification: missing/corrupt state → UNKNOWN → WARM + alert
  (corruption masquerades as inactivity — the classifier must fail toward
  MORE frequency, never less). New repo (no state) → HOT bootstrap.
- The per-owner reality: KyaniteLabs is an org (/orgs/ probe);
  simongonzalezdc is a USER (/users/ probe — /orgs/ 404s). Forgejo-primary
  repos have NO GitHub pushed signal → default WARM (LEARNINGS #24: this
  org merges in ~60s — a busy Forgejo repo silently parked cold is a
  regression).
- Duplicate configs (same repo: value) ALERT, never silent-dedupe
  (resonant-gifts + resonant-tastecheck both name resonant-tastecheck
  today — the fleet has been double-cycling it hourly).
- Cadence is a latency knob, not a correctness knob (the head-SHA
  predicate self-heals); the watermark catch-up is unbounded once it
  exists, so cold repos lose nothing but time.

Output: one config filename per line whose repo is DUE this cycle, plus
ALERT lines (surfaced by the runner's unconditional ALERT grep). The
scheduler ALSO prints the aggregate plan line for runner.log.
