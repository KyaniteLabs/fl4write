"""Issues lane — triage for GitHub + Forgejo issues (not PRs).

Collects new issues, runs LLM triage (duplicate detection, label routing,
answer drafting from repo law), posts a single triage comment. Comment-only:
never closes, never reassigns, never edits labels via API (the comment
SUGGESTS labels; a human applies them).

Config surface: `issues_enabled: true` in the repo config AND the runner passes
`--issues`; either missing disables the lane.
State: tracks `last_triaged_number` per repo (issues are numbered; we
triage everything with a number > last_triaged).
