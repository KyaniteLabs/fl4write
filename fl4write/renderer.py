"""Renderer: the BEHAVIOR.md comment contract + tone presets + design system v1.

Persistent-comment law: ONE comment per PR, created once, then EDITED IN PLACE
on every re-review (edit-in-place never re-notifies — Codecov's law). New
findings get the 🆕 delta marker; findings present last cycle and gone now are
listed under ✅ Resolved. Tone is a renderer-only preset: the analyzer is
tone-blind; roast is internal-only and HARD-overridden for fork PRs and
first-time contributors; security-urgency is always rendered regardless of tone.

Design system v1: severity emoji badges, severity-count table header,
collapsible fix proposals, visible branded footer, personality per tone.

Audit 2026-09-01: the finding-line format has ONE source of truth here —
render_finding emits it, FINDING_LINE_RE parses it back, and a round-trip test
pins them together. The engine previously parsed a legacy format nothing
emitted, so `previous_findings` was always empty and every finding was 🆕
forever. Resolved findings now actually render (✅ section) instead of
vanishing silently.
