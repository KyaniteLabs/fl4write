"""Gatekeeper — the nit-killer second pass.

Runs between the analyzer and the poster. Takes the findings list, asks the
model (with a staff-engineer persona) which findings are WORTH POSTING vs
which are noise/nits that will be ignored. Drops the noise before it becomes
comment fatigue. Implements the Greptile lesson: 79% nits = 19% address rate;
filtered = 55%+.

The gatekeeper NEVER escalates severity or adds findings — it only filters.
Config: `gatekeeper: false` in the repo config disables the pass entirely
(the engine reads the flag).

Audit 2026-09-01 hardening:
- FAIL-OPEN IS REAL NOW: any exception class (HTTPError, URLError, timeout,
  RuntimeError, TypeError...) returns all findings. The old tuple missed the
  most common failure classes and CRASHED the whole cycle, losing its state.
- The keep-list is validated: lines coerced to int, paths stripped. An empty
  or unparseable keep-set while findings exist = parse failure = fail-open —
  never "drop everything and post 🎉 over real findings".
- Dropped findings are logged WITH identity (path:line, rule, message head) —
  the 21-dropped-unknown incident made tuning blind.
- The org-law addendum rides the same system prompt as the analyzer.
