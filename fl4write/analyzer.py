"""Analyzer: LLM-brained findings behind two hard gates.

Gate 1 (scrub): every byte crossing the trust boundary is scrubbed (scrub.py).
Gate 2 (grounding): a finding is POSTED only if its rule_id exists in
config.review / the built-in vocab AND its path exists in the diff file-set
and its severity exists in config.severity_vocab. Grounding failures are
dropped AND LOGGED, never posted. The model's output is DATA until code
validates it — never a direct path to a write (ralplan-approved boundary).

Model routing: config-declared endpoint/model (champion lane), payload-asserted,
with optional fallback route; failure of both = the cycle reports
"model-unavailable" and marks the PR unreviewed (never silent skip).
Dependency-PR policy (Lane C): bot-authored PRs get the configured skip depth.

Audit 2026-09-01 hardening:
- The response envelope is validated: `{"findings": null}` / shape drift is a
  ModelUnavailable (retriable), NEVER conflated with "no findings" — a
  schema-drifted response used to post "✨ Clean review, go merge it".
- Every dropped finding is logged WITH its reason (org law: log-what-you-dropped).
- Truncation is disclosed: the prompt carries a truncation marker and the
  renderer a partial-review banner.
- The org-law addendum (law.py) is injected into the system prompt.
- path_filters.ignore is applied to grounded findings.
