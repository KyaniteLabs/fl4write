"""Engine: one poll-invariant cycle per repo — collect, dedupe, review, fix, triage.

Design laws (ralplan-approved):
- The head-SHA predicate decides re-review; trigger reason is annotation only.
- get_diff is REQUIRED: grounding without a real diff file-set is vacuous.
- ONE state owner per cycle: this module loads once and saves once; lanes
  mutate the dict (a lane doing its own load+save caused the email-storm
  lost update — LEARNINGS #17). Checkpoint saves after each PR keep a
  mid-cycle kill from losing the whole cycle's memory.
- Per-PR containment: one PR's forge/model failure never aborts the others
  and never loses the cycle's state (the mirror degrade law, extended to
  primaries).

Audit 2026-09-01:
- previous_findings now parses the RENDERER's actual format via
  renderer.parse_finding_lines (the old regex matched a format nothing
  emitted — every finding was 🆕 forever and ✅ resolution never existed).
- config.gatekeeper and config.issues_enabled are honored (dead knobs).
- A model-failure retry cap per (PR, SHA) stops the infinite retry loop on
  permanently unparseable generations.
- Deadline awareness: start no new PR when the remaining budget can't fit a
  review, so a runner kill can't livelock the repo (LEARNINGS #24 class).
