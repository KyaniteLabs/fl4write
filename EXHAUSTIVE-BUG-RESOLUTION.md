# EXHAUSTIVE BUG-RESOLUTION LOOP — requested FL4WRITE behavior

Interrupted recon retains a validated chunk prefix for the same round. Checkpoints
bind the complete ledger, source archive, selected request and worker implementation;
each new round requires fresh inference. Failed attempts remain charged, including
calls interrupted before their response is checkpointed. Retries need room within
the originally selected whole-round budget. Partial coverage never advances a round.

**Status: feature request (CEO word 2026-09-04, PM-3 intake) — behavior spec, not yet
implemented. Implementation = feature tranche; per standing authority #2 it ships only after a
delegate quorum audit, and per org habit every defect found while building it lands a regression
pin + LEARNINGS entry.**

- Origin: CEO chat, 2026-09-04 (FL4WRITE PM-3 session), before the MECE gauntlet resumed.
- The same pattern lives in org rules: workspace `AGENTS.md` § EXHAUSTIVE BUG-RESOLUTION LOOP
  PATTERN (org-wide rule surface); law-pack changelog entry pending via COO.
- Tracker: KyaniteLabs/fl4write issue #13.
- This loop is the identical contract the 2026-09 MECE gauntlet runs on FL4WRITE itself
  (3 consecutive zero-new full rounds) — the product behavior must be dogfooded on its own repo
  before it is trusted on others.

## What the CEO asked (verbatim, lightly cleaned)

> This is a pattern — an exhaustive bug resolution pattern. Loop one: reconnaissance (detect
> bugs), then fix, then refresh everything, take note of what you did, REFRESH CONTEXT WINDOW,
> then go again — try to find as many bugs as possible, then fix, then refresh everything, take
> note of what you did, then new context window again, etc. The loop continues until at least
> 3 100% green loops with zero regressions. The loop will fully exhaustively flush out and fix
> all bugs from a "finished" or closed-to-finished project. — It is a type of behavior expected
> out of FL4WRITE when deemed necessary or requested.

## The loop contract (canonical)

**ROUND = recon → fix → refresh → note → fresh context.**

1. **RECON (detect bugs)** — fresh-eyes, exhaustive adversarial pass over the WHOLE project at
   current HEAD. Find as many real bugs as possible. Every finding must carry evidence
   (file:line or verbatim quote of the reviewed bytes); uncited findings are discarded.
   Recon runs in a NEW context window every round — no long-context session loops on itself.
2. **FIX** — every valid finding is fixed with a regression pin; the full verification suite must
   be 100% green afterwards; zero regressions vs the previous round.
3. **REFRESH EVERYTHING** — subjects, packs, fixtures, state and artifacts are re-generated from
   the post-fix HEAD. Auditing a stale tree re-opens already-fixed items and hides new ones.
4. **NOTE** — what this round did (findings, fixes, pins, verdicts) is appended to the persistent
   round ledger. The ledger is the only thing that crosses rounds.
5. **FRESH CONTEXT** — next round starts from the ledger, not from this round's context.

Model prompts carry each prior test-ID list as a count and SHA256 digest of its
ordered canonical JSON (sorted keys, compact separators, trailing newline).
All other ledger fields remain available to the model. Complete test IDs remain
in the archived ledger input and canonical state for regression and replay checks;
the prompt summary is never verification authority.

**EXIT CONTRACT — three consecutive green loops.** A round is GREEN iff:

- recon produced ZERO new valid defects (desk-verified; dup/invalid verdicts recorded), AND
- the full suite runs 100% green at the round's HEAD (evidence stored — junit/run logs — not
  prose), AND
- zero regressions against the previous round's green baseline (every test that passed before
  still passes).

Any round that finds new valid defects, or regresses the suite, resets the consecutive-green
counter to 0 (after its fixes land). The loop ends only when the counter reaches 3 — then the
project may be certified **exhaustively flushed @ `<sha>`**, with the ledger as evidence.
Never declare exhaustion early; exhaustion is a certification, not a feeling.

### Optional local desk dispositions

The CLI accepts `--desk-adjudications DIR` as an explicit trust choice by the local
operator. The directory must be outside the reviewed checkout. Without this option,
every grounded finding remains actionable through the existing fix gates.

With this option, a round with findings pauses before tests or fixes and writes a
`desk-request.json` artifact. That request includes the raw findings, a decision
template, and the required filename. An independent desk reviewer fills the template
and places it in the selected directory using that filename. The reviewer label is
provenance, not authentication; selecting the directory is what authorizes its input.
Repository files and model responses are never treated as desk authorization.

Each decision must match the exact reviewed HEAD and sealed recon digest and cover
every unique finding fingerprint once, with a nonempty rationale. The accepted
verdicts are `valid`, `invalid`, and `duplicate`. Only `invalid` excludes a finding
from repair; a duplicate label remains actionable and cannot hide an unresolved
defect. Repeated identical raw findings share one fingerprint decision while their
raw occurrence count remains intact. Empty recon results need no desk file.

Resume with the same HEAD and request settings. Pending recon and its reservations
are reused. Once accepted, decision bytes are sealed before testing; later edits to
the external file cannot change a retry. Adjudicated round evidence retains the raw
findings, the original recon reference, and accepted decisions. Eligible green rounds
also require full-suite JUnit. Recovery recomputes valid counts from that evidence.
Public adjudicated rows include raw and valid counts plus the decision digest; private findings and rationales stay
out. An invalid-only round still needs the complete green suite, unchanged test
coverage, and all three rounds before the existing certification/publication gates.

**Why:** round-N reviewers are structurally blind to round-N bugs; every fix round can introduce
new bugs; only fresh-eyes re-entry plus a hard 3-clean-rounds bar reliably exhausts a codebase.

## When FL4WRITE engages it ("deemed necessary or requested")

Requested (explicit): a human asks for an exhaustive flush on a repo — via per-repo central
config, issue, or command (surface decided at implementation). Default OFF.

Deemed necessary (automatic): to be defined at implementation, candidates only —
repo reaches a finished/closed-to-finished marker (release gate, PILOT-style graduation, a
"done" claim on a tracked deliverable, gauntlet-final-layer verdict needing a flush), or an
omnisweep/retro closeout finds the repo eligible. Automatic triggers stay conservative and are
never guessed from prose alone.

## Product shape of one round (mapping onto existing machinery)

| Pattern step | Existing machinery | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RECON (whole tree, fresh context) | omnisweep-semantics full-tree scan at HEAD + analyzer + gatekeeper + scrub/render containment | each round = new engine invocation / fresh model session; round notes are the only carry-over; freshness gate applies (no zombie findings on moved code) |
| FIX | fix lane (own PRs only; fork rail comment-only) | per-finding stable-id PRs or contained patches, as omnisweep fix phase does; Critical/Major floor configurable |
| Green evidence | verify-tests with junit aggregation (`test_cmd`, aggregated testsuites) | full-suite run, not diff-only: this is an exhaustion loop, its gate is the whole suite |
| REFRESH | re-generate round packs from post-fix HEAD; reload state | stale-subject discipline, like the gauntlet's refresh-packs |
| NOTE | round ledger appended to the per-repo audit issue (edited in place) + state + telemetry | ledger survives, context does not |
| Counters | per-repo state: round number, consecutive-green, green-baseline SHA + junit evidence refs | int-normalized persistence (retro_seen lesson) |
| Certification | final audit-issue edit: "exhaustively flushed @ sha" + ledger + evidence refs; telemetry event | human-visible artifact on the repo |

## Defensive constraints (must survive this repo's own gauntlet before shipping)

- **Evidence, not prose**: a green round requires stored run evidence (aggregated junit / logs).
  No evidence ⇒ round is NOT green.
- **Outage ≠ green**: forge/model/runner failure defers the round; a truncated or failed round
  never counts as recon-complete and never counts green. Counter untouched on deferral.
- **Shape containment** at every adapter boundary (forge rows, junit XML, ledger state) — a
  malformed artifact degrades the round, never crashes the loop or fakes a verdict.
- **Bounded loop**: hard per-repo round cap + spend bounds per round (model budget like
  omnisweep's max_*); cap exceeded ⇒ escalate to an issue with the ledger attached, never
  silently stop. Loop must not become a permanent cost drain on a repo that will not flush.
- **Per-repo isolation**: one repo's loop (or its failure) never affects other repos' cycles.
- **Fresh context is structural**: rounds MUST be new contexts over the ledger; a config that
  lets one long session "loop" is a violation of the pattern, not an implementation of it.
- **Exit discipline**: certification only at 3 consecutive green; any new-valid-defect or
  regression round resets to 0. The 3-green bar is the whole point.

## Acceptance criteria (definition of done for the tranche)

1. A repo can be put into exhaustive-loop mode by request (config/command/issue), default off,
   and the trigger is documented.
2. Each round runs recon→fix→refresh→note on a fresh context with the ledger crossing rounds;
   round packs come from the post-fix HEAD.
3. Full-suite evidence gates each round; deferral on outage; truncated rounds never count.
4. Consecutive-green counter persists, resets on any non-green round, survives crashes/restarts,
   and certification fires exactly at 3 with a ledger + evidence artifact on the repo.
5. Bounds, escalation, per-repo isolation and containment all have regression pins.
6. Quorum delegate audit (fresh-context reviewer, standing authority #2) passes before any
   fleet enablement; the tranche itself survived the exhaustive loop on fl4write's own repo.

## Open questions at intake (decide at implementation, record rulings on the issue)

- Trigger surface: config flag vs issue command vs both; who may request.
- Automatic "deemed necessary" markers — which, if any, ship in v1.
- Round/loop caps, spend bounds, severity floor for the fix phase.
- Certification surface (audit issue state, comment, telemetry event schema).
- Interaction with tier scheduling on the runner (exhaustive loops are bursty by nature).
