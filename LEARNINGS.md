> **Rename 2026-09-01:** `codesitter` → **Fl4wRite** (`fl4write`). Historical entries below keep the old name; the old marker `codesitter:v1:` is still RECOGNIZED by lookups so pre-rename comments are never duplicated.

# codesitter learnings (each paid for on 2026-08-31, build day)

1. **Marker-substring identity is hijackable.** Any commenter can write your marker; persistent-comment lookup must verify author == bot identity. (Review gate, runtime-verified.)
2. **Shadow state poisons cutover.** Shadow outcomes must never count as reviewed, or the live flip no-ops forever. Distinct outcome keys; the predicate treats them as unreviewed.
3. **Vacuous grounding celebrates over Criticals.** A missing diff fetcher defaulting to `set()` drops every finding and posts 🎉 while reporting success. Required parameters beat defaults for correctness-critical inputs.
4. **Mirrors are optimizations, never dependencies.** An unreachable mirror must degrade (log+skip), not abort the primary cycle. Caught by the first live smoke run.
5. **Model prose is not JSON.** "I cannot comply" crashes json.loads outside the ModelUnavailable path — contain parse failures per-PR, never lose the whole cycle's state.
6. **Delta keys must use the real rule id.** Reconstructing prior findings with a hardcoded rule mints 🆕 on every cycle for every configured-rule finding.
7. **reasoning_effort: max burns completion budget on hidden reasoning** (DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731): ≥8000 max_tokens or accept medium. (Landscape lane A.)
8. **Harness automations pause on prompt edit** — a safety gate with no API bypass; deployment plans must budget the one enable-click.
9. **Edit-in-place never re-notifies** (Codecov law, corpus-confirmed) — the persistent-comment law exists because notifications, not content, are the spam surface.
10. **Tone is delivery, not detection** (Kilo roast mode evidence) — renderer-only presets keep the analyzer honest and forks safe.
11. **A merged adoption can be silently lost to a racing branch.** Innerscape #304 merged clean — then a branch based on older main landed on top and main reverted to .coderabbit.yaml-only. Lesson: verify the artifact ON MAIN after every adoption merge (contents API), not just the merge event; re-adopt on current main if lost (#305).
12. **App removal is NOT cosmetic.** CodeRabbit still posts default walkthroughs after .coderabbit.yaml removal — the app must be uninstalled (settings UI) or it keeps reviewing alongside codesitter (seen live on the kinocut inaugural).
13. **PR-head propagation lags seconds after a push** — a cycle run immediately post-push sees the old SHA and correctly skips; the head-SHA predicate self-heals on the next cycle (designed behavior, verified live).
14. **bot_login must equal the posting account.** The hijack-defense author check with a mismatched default rejects OUR OWN persistent comment → double-post. Configurable now, wired to adapters.
15. **Inaugural proof (live, kinocut #503):** all three paths verified in production — 🎉 celebration (clean diff), grounded Critical finding (planted token → rule `secrets` + proposal), edit-in-place on re-review (one comment, updated with 🆕).
16. **Active repos eat adoptions twice.** Elixis (#149) lost its config to a racing branch exactly like Innerscape (#304) — verify-once is insufficient while branches are in flight. Countermeasure: the runner now verifies in-repo config presence on main EVERY cycle and alerts on loss.

## 17. One state owner per cycle (the email storm, 2026-09-01)
The engine loads state at cycle start; the issues lane did its OWN load+save
mid-cycle; the engine's end-of-cycle save then overwrote the file from its
stale in-memory copy — wiping `last_triaged_number` EVERY cycle. Combined
with a bot_login identity mismatch (posting as kyanitelabs[bot], checking for
simongonzalezdc), every run re-triaged every open issue as a NEW comment:
maintainers got the same triage email 3–4× (237 duplicate comments deleted
across 15 repos). Fix: lanes mutate the engine-owned dict; ONE save. Plus a
marker-under-any-identity guard: never post a second copy, skip + log.
**Law: any module that persists state must receive the shared state dict, never
its own load/save pair.**

## 18. Renames need diff review, not grep-and-pray
The line-filtered codesitter→fl4write sweep protected the marker literals but
silently rewrote a URL string — the surveillance fallback probe ended up
checking `.fl4write.yaml` twice, printing a spurious "adoption lost" alert for
every repo. Grep for the old name AFTER a sweep and eyeball every remaining
hit; a "protected literals" list protects literals, not identifiers-in-strings.

## 19. Identity follows the token, or edit-in-place dies
bot_login must match the identity the token posts AS. With per-repo app
installations the poster is kyanitelabs[bot]; a hardcoded personal login makes
every "find my comment" lookup miss → new comment instead of edit → email.
bot_login is now derived from the auth route (app=bot, PAT fallback=user).

## 20. Renaming a GitHub App changes the bot login (2026-09-01)
CEO renamed the app kyanitelabs → "Fl4wRite"; the SLUG followed, so the
posting identity changed kyanitelabs[bot] → fl4write[bot] — while every
identity check in the codebase still expected the old login. That is the
email-storm failure mode reborn, caught only because "verify the CEO's
clicks via GET /app" was run instead of taking the confirmation at face
value. Fix: bot_login defaults follow the current slug; comments authored
under legacy slugs are recognized as ours (is_own_identity).
**Law: after ANY app-settings change, re-fetch /app and diff name, slug, and
avatar — the slug is identity.**

## 21. Ruleset repos reject direct contents-PUT with 409 (2026-09-01)
8 of 31 repos return "Repository rule violations found — Changes must be
made through a pull request" on contents PUT (409, not 403). Branch+PR+merge
is the route; research-scout additionally allows ONLY squash merges (merge
PUT 405s with "Merge commits are not allowed"). Also: never pin branch=main
on contents calls — several repos default to master (404).

## 22. .bashrc is invisible to cron and SSH (and its values may be quoted)
Non-interactive shells never reach ~/.bashrc exports (Ubuntu early-return),
so cron-run processes see no model key — and the .bashrc value can be
wrapped in literal double quotes, which survive `cut -d= -f2-` and 401 the
Authorization header. Extract with quote-stripping inside the runner script
itself (run-cycle.sh carries this, host-guarded).

## 23. Before asking the CEO to click, query what is observable (2026-09-01)
"Install the app on your user account" turned out to be already-installed
since May — the real bug was a hardcoded org installation ID. GitHub App
state is fully observable via GET /app/installations with the app JWT.
**Law: a click request is a last resort; every checkable claim gets checked
first.**

## 24. The hourly poller structurally misses fast-merged PRs (2026-09-01)
Evidence from the first real PR flow (the CEO's Wave-2/2b docs sweep): PRs open
and merge in ~60 seconds (tastecheck #19: created 00:24, merged 00:25); some
wave merges never appear as GitHub PRs at all (Forgel-side/agent merges pushed
to main). An hourly poll that only sees OPEN PRs reviews none of them. In this
org, agent-driven fast-merge IS the normal PR flow — so the v1 polling trigger
reviews almost nothing real. Mitigations: (a) post-merge review mode (review
PRs merged since the last watermark; findings land as post-merge comments,
fixes ride follow-up PRs); (b) the chartered v2 event trigger (webhook via the
app — permissions already granted). Also: 8 repos lost configs to the same
sweep (stale-based merges landing on main — LEARNINGS class #16/#18): sweep
tooling MUST rebase onto fresh main before landing.

## 25. The six-lane audit: error paths downgrade to success-shaped data (2026-09-01)
CEO-ordered MECE adversarial audit (state/security/API/LLM/config/ops lanes,
~60 findings, 13 Critical). The dominant systemic pattern: FAILURE PATHS
SILENTLY PRODUCE THE SAME SHAPE AS SUCCESS — a failed diff fetch returned
the empty set (posted a celebration over real findings, marked reviewed
forever); a >1MB file fetched as "" let the model fabricate a whole file;
an empty gatekeeper keep-list dropped every finding and posted "clean";
git clone -b HEAD failed so the fix lane had never once worked (and had it
worked, would have silently reverted main — default-branch tree + PR-head
content). Second pattern: THREE MODULES DISAGREED ABOUT THE COMMENT FORMAT
(renderer emitted one shape, engine and metrics parsed a legacy one) — which
alone killed delta markers, resolution tracking, AND the acceptance metric.
Third: the fail-open/containment contracts were honored only in the analyzer
— the gatekeeper's narrow except tuple crashed whole cycles on routine 429s.
Laws: (a) every error path must return a shape that CANNOT be mistaken for
success (None, an exception, a sentinel the caller must handle); (b) one
source of truth for any serialized format, with a round-trip test; (c)
"fail-open" means except Exception or it isn't; (d) a knob wired to nothing
is worse than no knob (extra=forbid + dead-knob wiring). Also: set -u
demands ${VAR:-} — the hardened runner was itself killed by an unbound
variable on its first deploy. 102 tests (was 50), one per critical class.


## 26. "Did you fix EVERYTHING?" is itself a test (2026-09-01)
After the six-lane audit's fix pass (102 tests green, deployed), the CEO asked
whether every single finding was fixed. Re-auditing the claim against the six
lane reports found EIGHT more fixable residuals (merge-gate rejecting legacy
identities, metrics reactions calling a method that didn't exist, the README
still saying "Formerly Fl4wRite", dead params, missing module tests...). The
fix pass had closed the criticals so cleanly that the long tail felt done.
**Law: a completeness claim is only as good as a line-by-line recheck against
the source list — 'all tests green' verifies the fixes you MADE, not the
findings you MISSED. Remaining opens must be an explicit, documented decision
list, never silence.**

## 27. Lint/tool contracts must be explicit — defaults drift with versions (2026-09-01)
PM-1's final commit passed "ruff clean" locally (0.15.8) and FAILED CI
(0.16.5): ruff widened its default rule set between minor versions, so the
same code was clean under one implicit contract and 38-errors dirty under
another. The failure sat red on main because local runs could not see it.
Same class as the dead-knob law: an implicit contract is a contract nobody
signed. **Law: any tool whose config selects nothing has selected
"whatever this version defaults to" — pin the rule set (or equivalent
contract) explicitly, and verify with the EXACT version CI runs (a venv
install; `pip install` on macOS refuses via PEP 668 and silently leaves the
old binary in place, which once made a 'verified under CI's version' check a
no-op).** Corollary: "green locally" is a claim about YOUR versions; CI is
the only authority on CI's versions.

## 28. Stale implicit contracts strike on every new forge surface (2026-09-01)
Three same-day repeats of old laws on Forgejo: the CF-fronted forge showed
GET-passes/POST-fails (error-shapes-must-differ, #25's class), master-default
repos rejected implicit-branch contents writes (#21's twin), and the "no
admin token" conclusion dissolved once the ssh config's full host list was
read — the origin was the VPS, with a container CLI that creates users
without any API token. **Law: porting a working system to a new surface
re-runs its whole incident history — before building, enumerate the new
surface's own versions of every law already learned; before declaring an
action blocked, enumerate every host AND CLI you can already reach.**

## 29. The author is structurally blind — delegate audits are load-bearing (2026-09-02)
Two fresh reviewers (GLM-5.3-max subagent; gpt-5.6-sol via codex) found 2
Critical + 7 Major in a batch its author had already passed five times —
including a token file sitting INSIDE the test sandbox and a counter that
had never counted since deploy. Then the CEO's completeness check ("did you
fix EVERY finding?") exposed SIX unfixed items behind the author's own
"all fixed" — LEARNINGS #26 repeating on the author himself. **Law: every
feature tranche ships with one fresh-context delegate audit BEFORE deploy
(third-reviewer class; quorum: MiniMax-M3 + Sol + mimo-v2.5-pro); a
completeness claim by the author is a hypothesis, checked line-by-line
against the source list, never a report.**
## 30. Prompts do not catch self-failing diffs — RUN them (2026-09-02)
Both MiniMax-M3 and deepseek gave a planted, test-failing diff a clean
review — TWICE EACH — including once with an explicit tests-are-the-spec
prompt contract. The fix was structural, not rhetorical: verify_diff_tests
executes the diff's own tests in the sandboxed worktree; a failing diff is
a deterministic Critical that the gatekeeper cannot drop and the fix lane
cannot auto-patch (it anchors at the TEST — test-weakening is one lane
away). The planted-bug corpus (tests/test_planted_diffs.py) is the standing
Q1 instrument: deterministic layer 100% by construction, model recall
measured live. **Law: when a deterministic check is possible, prompt
harder second — and the eval corpus grows from every production miss.**

## 31. Capability rules must be DEPLOYED, not just defined (2026-09-02)
The CheckYourself integration defined 19 capability rules in capabilities.py
but shipped without wiring them into config loading. The grounding gate
(analyzer rule_id must exist in config.review) would have dropped every
capability-citing finding. Both non-GLM auditors (Sol + M3) caught it
independently — the author had written the rules, tested the scoring, and
assumed deployment. **Law: a new rule/schema/feature must be verified LIVE
against the production grounding/config path before the commit message says
'ships' — definition without deployment is a dead knob (LEARNINGS #25d
reborn).**
## 32. The fix-pass needs the same verification bar as the bug it fixes (2026-09-02)
An indentation error in the list-response guard broke 28 tests. The guard
was correct logic at wrong indentation — Python's syntax caught it, but
only because the test suite imports executor.py at collection time.
Without the suite, the fix would have shipped broken and taken down the
ci_watch lane on the next cycle. **Corollary to LEARNINGS #25: a fix's
test run IS the verification — but only if the test suite exercises the
fixed path. The ultraqa gauntlet caught this because baseline
verification (step 2) runs the suite FIRST.**

## 33. Desks transfer by retirement, never by parallel operation (2026-09-02)
The ZCode→DSH migration's failure mode was never the new desk — it was
two desks alive at once: duplicate tracker posts, conflicting reviews,
racing commits on shared state. Same failure class as a two-host runner:
the automation layer is platform-agnostic; the judgment layer is
single-occupant. The transfer instrument was one self-contained prompt
(PM3-HANDOFF.md) carrying verified state numbers, standing authorities,
traps, prioritized open loops, and the access map — deliberately
sufficient WITHOUT the old desk's session memory. The old desk's last act
was proving it holds nothing open: no crons, no background workers,
clean tree, everything pushed. **Law: moving an agent desk across
platforms = retire-then-spawn; the handoff prompt must be the only
dependency, and retirement is not complete until the old side's write
paths are provably closed.**

## 34. Config and adoption identity follows the forge of truth (2026-09-03)
PM-3's first session found two live defect classes in the fleet's config layer.
(a) Six dual-homed org repos (kinocut, Epoch, Innerscape, checkyourself,
devarch-framework, Elixis) carried TWO central configs naming the same repo
key (X + X.fj after the Sep-2 Forgejo sweep). The loader dedupes by repo key:
one config cycles (alphabetically first — the .fj), the other shadows forever
and ALERTs every cycle (18 cycles of noise, ~6 lines each). With the CEO's
all-FJ order the Forgejo side IS the live review surface (open FJ PR queues
on kinocut/Epoch/Innerscape, reviewed by the .fj configs; ZERO GitHub PR
merges on any of the six since Sep 2) — the GitHub configs were wave-1 era
shadow configs and were retired. (b) Adoption losses: tastecheck + complyos
lost their in-repo .fl4write.yaml to force-land sweeps landing on main
(racing-branch law, mirror form — the sweep carries a stale tree), and
resonant-constable + resonant-context-kit were armed 09-03 with no in-repo
adoption at all. Both classes ALERTed every cycle. Also caught: 671eb01
removed the wrong-target resonant-gifts CENTRAL config, but the same
wrong-target content (repo: resonant-tastecheck, floor route) still lived
INSIDE simongonzalezdc/resonant-gifts — and it contaminated my first
adoption template before self-correction (every adoption must mirror the
target repo's own central config). **Law: config + adoption identity follows
the forge of truth — one central config per repo, on the forge where its PRs
merge; an adoption survives only while every lander (PR, push, or force-land)
carries it — sweep force-lands cut from stale bases eat it (racing-branch
law; mirror-synced copies track the forge of truth and survive, verified on
the six org repos); every adoption carries the repo's OWN central config
content and is verified contents-on-branch after landing.** Fleet: 152→146 central configs; repo-key
uniqueness pinned by tests/test_fleet_configs.py (the loader cannot cycle
two configs for one repo — duplicate keys are shadowed, never run).

## 35. macOS case-insensitivity hides fixture-path drift from CI (2026-09-03)
CI on main was RED from 2026-09-02 17:12 UTC for ~10 hours - every push failed
test_forgejo_warm_floor while local runs stayed green, so the 'CI green'
handoff claim (measured on the laptop, not the runner) was stale by the time
PM-3 sat down. Root cause: the test wrote its fixture as
simon__cncl.state.json while _state_path('simon/CNCL') builds
simon__CNCL.state.json - on macOS's case-insensitive APFS the read
succeeds and the test passes; on Linux CI the file does not exist and the
classifier took the bootstrap path (hot != warm). The tiers tranche added the
failing test; every commit since (the ultraqa fixes, LEARNINGS #31/32 docs,
the PM-3 handoff, PM-2's close-out) sat red unseen. The own-repo ci_watch
WORKED (ci_red=1 every cycle since 23:00, escalation issues #9-#11 on
KyaniteLabs/fl4write, fix attempts failed Linux verification) - the missing
piece was a human reading gh run list. **Law: a test that writes files must
build their paths with the SAME code the production path uses (hand-typed
fixture filenames are a contract nobody signed - LEARNINGS #27's class on a
new surface: filesystem case semantics); 'CI green' is a claim about the CI
runner - read gh run list, never local pytest.** Fix: fixture written via
tiers._state_path, pinned by construction.

## 36. CI run-level annotations are meta, not code findings (2026-09-03)
ci_watch minted Major findings from EVERY check annotation - and GitHub Actions
emits run-level auto-annotations anchored at the WORKFLOW DIRECTORY (path
'.github', lines = workflow YAML lines: 'Node.js 20 is deprecated', 'Process
completed with exit code 1.'). The fix lane then correctly refused to fetch a
directory (executor._get_file_content returns None for list responses - the
f1088e3 guard), so every red head burned a fix attempt on '.github' and
escalated. Root cause: ci_watch assumed annotation.path == source file; GH
violates that for run-level annotations. **Law: any CI-annotation surface must
mint findings only for paths that are FILES at the relevant ref - an HTTP 200
from the contents API is not a file (directories answer with a list); the
forge adapter's path_is_file() is the one truth, fail-open on None.** Fixed:
adapter path_is_file(repo, path, ref) + mint-time filter in _ci_watch_step + 3
regression tests.


## 37. A wedged agent session is recoverable — and expensive to abandon (2026-09-03)
The PM-3 DSH session wedged three ways in one day: a deepseek-lane 502 queue-full
(07:46Z-cycle end), a model request that never returned (~5h20m, 08:29-13:51), and
then ~70 minutes of tool-call emission failures (`unknown tool ""` — empty tool
names on larger calls, small calls fine) that blocked landing the UltraQA
adversarial test pass (turns 9-11, aborted by the CEO at 14:01 and 15:00). The
in-flight work survived ONLY because the harness records every streamed tool-call
argument in the session transcript (`~/.dsh/sessions/<ws>/session-<id>/session.jsonl.zstd`,
10.6k events, 8MB) — the full intended test suite was reconstructed byte-for-byte
from the recorded attempts and landed green in a fresh session. **Law: significant
multi-step changes land in the repo at each green step, never as one pending
giant append; when a lane misbehaves (queue-full, wedged request, empty tool
names), stop burning turns — switch the route and keep tool calls small, then
recover the in-flight payloads from the session JSONL.** Rescue path proven
2026-09-03: decompress the zstd transcript, extract `tool/call` + `assistant/message`
tool-call arguments, diff the successive attempts, land the latest complete draft.

## 38. Posted severity is not finding quality — adjudication is the instrument (2026-09-03)
The Q1 proxy (posted Critical+Major share as "finding quality") was wrong: a severity label is
the MODEL's claim, not a verdict. First desk adjudication round (CTO + CS consults,
council-consult-2026-09-03-fl4write-quality, code at the reviewed SHAs): of 23 posted findings
on liminal post-merge reviews, **8 FALSE incl. 7 of 10 Criticals** — bodies said "tests pass /
no issue / assertion is correct" then posted Critical, or cited test content that does not
exist in the file (HTML-escaped markup fabricated from an unread test file). Honest quality
~9-30% vs the 55-85% proxy: **3-6x overstated**. Mechanisms: L1-B1 counted any message
containing "test" as verified (has_test = "test" in low); the self-contradiction guard scanned
only message[:120] for 3 phrases; and testing-quality Criticals never met the rubric's own bar
(verifiable failing diff test). **Law: severity-integrity gates are deterministic, not
prompts; Q1 = adjudicated REAL share from desk rounds; every posted C/M passes the
contradiction gate and the testing-quality ceiling.** Fixed: L1-B4 full-message
self-contradiction gate + L1-B5 testing-quality Critical ceiling (test_cmd-gated) + 12
regression tests pinning the sample escapes. The adjudication ALSO found the bot under-posts:
PR #1119's tempo shim rides addInitScript, which never runs for setContent pages — the crash
it claims to fix persists (missed-defect evidence, filed on the PR). Phase 2: citation
grounding — findings must quote the reviewed SHA's actual bytes (fabricated-premise class).

## 39. Speculative-security Criticals need code reading, not phrase gates (2026-09-03)
Sample residue after the L1-B4/L1-B5 tranche: two security-threat Criticals (items 13, 19 —
XSS-on-static-prepend, "prototype pollution" on a hardcoded shim list) survive every text
gate because their hedged conditionals ("could be exploited if the content is malicious /
if an attacker can influence…") are indistinguishable by text from the sample's REAL
security findings (items 17, 18 — same hedges, but the content IS user-uploaded playables
under --no-sandbox). The discriminator was domain knowledge of the trust boundary, which
deterministic message filters cannot encode. **Law: severity-integrity gates are necessary
but not sufficient — speculative-security Criticals require either citation grounding
(findings quote the reviewed bytes) or a Critical-only verification pass; until then their
survival is a tracked residue, not a closed class.** Sample effect: of the 10 posted
Criticals, 4 dropped + 4 floored to Major by the tranche; 2 (13, 19) remain as documented
residue for phase 2.

## 40. Text gates are whack-a-mole; grounding is the cure (2026-09-03, UltraQA round 1)
The readiness gauntlet (CEO: "FL4WRITE is NOT ready for use") ran the full adversarial
battery over the calibration tranche and the pipeline. New escapes found and fixed: (a) five
more self-refuting terminal phrases ("this is fine", "the diff is clean and safe to merge",
"tests all pass", "nothing wrong", "everything checks out") — every phrase list grows a
round behind the generator; (b) "the tests FAIL TO COVER the branch" bypassed the
failure-claim gate (coverage wording, not a failure); (c) a valid-JSON state file of the
wrong shape (list/str/int) crashed the whole cycle instead of bounded-reconciling;
(d) scrubbed finding text could still mint fake finding headings in the posted comment
(markdown structure is not a scrub class); (e) newline-bearing messages could break bullets
in escalation/issue bodies (engine, executor, fixlane — now single-lined via scrub.inline).
**Law: deterministic text filters are necessary but not sufficient — severity claims need
GROUNDING (cite the reviewed-SHA bytes; run the diff's tests when claiming they fail), and
every untrusted-text render site must be single-line/inert by construction.** Residue,
documented: speculative-security Criticals (hedged "could be exploited if…" on static code)
are text-indistinguishable from the real hedged findings — phase-2 citation grounding or a
Critical-only verification pass closes them (LEARNINGS #39). 357 tests green after the round.

## 41. Forge adapters are an untrusted input surface like everything else (2026-09-03, UltraQA round 2)
Round 2 of the readiness gauntlet: every adapter boundary must contain SHAPE errors, not
just ForgeError (HTTP): list_open_prs/merged rows missing fields, garbage rows, malformed
persistent-comment tuples, non-numeric annotation lines — any of them crashed the whole
cycle before the fix. Same law as round 1 in new clothes (assumed contract shape, LEARNINGS
#40): valid-JSON-wrong-shape state, forge rows of the wrong shape, CI annotation text
bypassing the analyzer scrub — all external surfaces need containment + scrubbing at THEIR
boundary, not downstream. Fixes: envelope ambiguity (a second DISTINCT {"fixed_content"} in
one model response refuses to parse — identical duplicates parse), adapter row guards +
shape-error tuples at open/merged listing, acceptance, comment-signals and retro sites,
ci_watch annotation scrub + line hardening, structural raw-HTML scrub (h1-h6/tables/divs),
fix-PR proposal heading-escape, testing-quality "fail to adequately cover" wording. Sol
audit round 2: GO-WITH-CHANGES, all 5 items closed with regression pins. 374 tests green.

## 42. Test gates need execution evidence, not exit codes (2026-09-03, UltraQA round 3)
Comorbidity #9's top predictions all CONFIRMED by probes: (P1) adapter shape errors crashed
cycles at post-merge listing, omnisweep tree shape/rows, issues-lane rows, ci_watch check-run
fields (numeric name, dict conclusion = unhashable against the benign set, numeric summary);
(P4) the fix-lane test gate was gameable — a hostile "fix" calling os._exit(0) at import time
kills pytest with rc 0 before any test runs, a false green that would push a process-killing
patch as a fix PR (sys.exit is caught by pytest; os._exit is not). Fix: _test_run_evidence —
green requires execution evidence: non-empty output (os._exit skips all flushing) and a
pytest summary line for pytest cmds; the verifier turns no-evidence rc-0 into a Critical
"UNVERIFIED" finding instead of a clean verdict. **Law: exit codes are a promise, output is
evidence — any auto-landing gate on a code-executing step (fix lane, verifier, CI-mimic) must
require both.** Sol audit round 3 (GO-WITH-CHANGES) hardened further: output TEXT is forgeable
too (flush a fake summary then os._exit(0)) — pytest gates now require a host-controlled
--junitxml artifact as COMPLETION evidence (tests>0, failures=0, errors=0). Honest
boundary (MECE round-1 F1-002/round-2 F2-005): the path is argv-visible to the same-user
test process, so a DETERMINED in-process adversary can forge it — the artifact defeats
accidental-kill and flush-then-exit classes; OS privilege separation is the real cure, and NON-pytest runners FAIL CLOSED on the fix gate until a per-runner evidence
mapping lands (fix lane: GitHub-only v1, zero landed fixes — blocking is free; the organic-PR
verifier keeps rc-based verdicts for non-pytest, silent-exit labeled unproven). 384 tests green.

## 43. The exhaustive loop is the instrument (2026-09-04, MECE round 1)
CEO protocol correction: a gauntlet is not exhaustive until FRESH-EYES members of a diverse
MECE team, re-auditing each round with a findings ledger, produce ZERO new valid findings on
THREE CONSECUTIVE full rounds. Round 1 (terra/luna/M3/sol/glm over 5 MECE domains) proved the
single-observer rounds 1-4 of the readiness pass were NOT exhaustive: it found 33 findings
incl. a CRITICAL the earlier pass shipped (executed test code could read ~/.sinter/config.json
= every org key via the sandbox HOME) and majors that invalidated shipped claims (junit
"host-controlled" evidence was argv-visible to the same-user process; Forgejo pagination used
per_page which the server ignores, silently capping every FJ list; the readiness
missing-evidence cap was inert code; check-runs merge gate unpaginated; issues triage failures
skipped forever). 28/33 fixed or ruled-by-design in round 1 across 7 commits; 5 open minors
queued. Law: product gates (fix lane, merge, posting) need fresh-eyes MECE re-audit rounds to
claim readiness; the earlier "battery complete" wording was withdrawn on the record.

## 44. Regression pins are host-independent or they are not pins (2026-09-04, MECE round 4)
Two round-3 regression pins opened the reviewed source via a HARDCODED MAC-LOCAL absolute path
(/Users/simongonzalezdecruz/workspaces/fl4write/...). Green on this laptop; CI red on EVERY
push from ~01:52Z (FileNotFoundError on the Ubuntu runner) until the bot's own ci_watch lane
filed fl4write #12 — a red stretch during which the README still claimed "CI on every push":
the honest-status rule means re-checking the CI badge, not the local suite, before quoting it.
Law: tests resolve repo paths from the test file (Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent) —
author/machine-specific absolutes are host-contaminated claims; a pin that only proves something
about THIS laptop is not a pin. Fixed in f068269 (REPO_ROOT), #12 closed with evidence.

## 45. Shadow is a dry run, not a preview (2026-09-04, MECE round 5)
Sol DOM-C reopened the shadow lifecycle with probes: shadow runs advanced LIVE discovery/action
belts — the post-merge watermark, retro_seen/cursor/completion, omnisweep completion, and
(historically) ci_acted — so the live cutover no-opped over what shadow had only LOOKED at, and
omnisweep completion without publication meant "retrying next cycle" was a lie (the complete
fast path returned before the upsert). Also in the same desk pass: a kill between the retro
checkpoint and its deferred-classification save permanently skipped a PR; a truncated tree
rendered COMPLETE; an abort rendered terminal; parked retro PRs promised re-arm "on the next
repo commit" that could never come. Laws: shadow belts are separate (pm_shadow_seen /
retro_shadow_seen) and live runs ignore them; state checkpoints happen only AFTER outcome
classification; completion is a whole-tree, published claim (omni_published retry contract);
aborts and truncations are never COMPLETE; parked state carries an expiry and re-arms
automatically. Regression pins: 9 red-pre-fix across engine/state/tiers.

## 46. Envelope refusal must survive JSON's own last-wins (2026-09-04, MECE round 6)
Terra reopened the envelope-injection class with a NEW vector: Python json keeps the LAST
duplicate key silently, so ONE object carrying two envelope keys
({"fixed_content":"SAFE","fixed_content":"injected"}) decoded to the attacker-chosen value and
BYPASSED the distinct-envelope refusal built in round 2 — same response, same fix target, new
layer. Same desk pass: message credentials were redacted only at RENDER, so the gatekeeper
prompt (a pre-render consumer) received model-quoted secrets verbatim (F1-013's dup-exposure
residual, now closed at construction); drop logs sliced BEFORE redacting so truncated tokens
leaked 'ghp' prefixes; the executor's OWN contents fetch still leniently decoded invalid base64
to an EMPTY file (F1-024 reopened — vacuous-premise), and calibration_snapshot crashed the CLI
after the cycle on corrupt stream bytes. Laws: decode with duplicate-key rejection
(object_pairs_hook) at every JSON boundary; redact at construction, not at the last renderer;
redact before truncation; empty premises and invalid payloads return None everywhere, twice.
5 regression pins, all red pre-fix.

## 47. Verify gates and dry-run belts need whole-path audits, twice (2026-09-04, MECE round 6)
The DOM-E desk reopened three 'fixed' classes with fresh evidence: (1) the round-5 shadow/live
separation covered post-merge and completion flags but retro still wrote the live retro_seen belt
at loop top and could set retro_complete under shadow, and omnisweep shadow advanced live cursor/
findings — cutovers still skipped unpublished work; (2) verify_diff_tests with an explicit pytest
test_cmd discarded the diff's own changed-test paths and ran the WHOLE suite (unrelated baseline
red mints a false 'deterministic' Critical on the changed file), filenames were joined then
split() (spaces and option-like names corrupt), and --junitxml appended after a '--' separator
would be parsed as a path; (3) the runner validated plan JSON syntax but not envelope shape
({\"due\": null} = silent empty cycle), and neither runner script guarded its cd. Plus: doc drift
reopened again (PILOT issues-lane + Forgejo-blocker claims, fleet count 129 vs 130, 'five
losses' that were six). Laws: every state write a dry-run mode performs must be audited per
WRITE, not per feature; diff-test verifiers target the diff's own files as argv elements behind
'--' with options inserted before the separator; plan envelopes validate shape, not just syntax;
cd failures exit loudly. 9 findings, 7 regression pins (5 new classes), all red pre-fix.

## 48. Shadow leakage audits must enumerate EVERY live write (2026-09-04, MECE round 6)
Luna-max re-audited the round-5/6 shadow separation with a per-WRITE sweep and found four more
live belts a dry run still touched: prune_closed ran on shadow cycles (deleting live records),
ci_watch's no-op else-branch persisted ci_acted:<head>, model-failure counters/cap were consumed
by shadow reviews (live cutover then never retried the SHA), and retro's clean/deferred/park
paths still mutated live state. Same desk pass: the tokenized CycleLock exit must verify
ownership (a zombie holder must never unlink the successor's lock) — and the new third token
field BROKE the legacy space-partition parser (live locks parsed as garbage and were stolen),
caught by the overlap test; watermarks/cursors need SEMANTIC ISO validation, not type checks
('0000' falsely completed retro); truthy non-list adapter envelopes (dict annotations, None
merged lists) crashed lanes; the post-merge watermark advanced past malformed row gaps; and the
deterministic verify finding was swallowed by model outages. Laws: shadow audit per WRITE;
token ownership verifies before unlink and parsers tolerate their own token format; watermarks
validate semantics; containers validate envelopes; row gaps stall watermarks; deterministic
evidence posts independently of the model. 9 fixes, 8 regression pins, all red pre-fix.

## 49. Envelopes, identifiers, probes, and cursors: the adapter re-audit (2026-09-04, MECE round 6)
Luna-max-2's DOM-D pass found the shape family one layer deeper: transport failures
(ConnectionReset/OSError/decode) escaped past the ForgeError boundary in both call paths; a
NaN/negative Retry-After reached time.sleep raw; check-runs/tree/comment ROW guards existed but
their RESPONSE envelopes and per-row sizes were unvalidated; write responses without an id
(uncertain side effects) raised KeyError instead of deferring; the Forgejo tree walk had no
cycle/depth bound (RecursionError on self-referential responses); path probes treated any 2xx
malformed payload as False/True instead of unqueryable None; the CLI's oversized-diff fallback
reviewed file NAMES with a literal sentence as the 'diff' (vacuous-premise class) and marked
the SHA reviewed; resolved-marker counting in metrics inflated on model-quoted text; closed
fix-depth records grew unbounded. Laws: every transport/parse failure is ForgeError-shaped;
throttle headers bound before sleep; responses validate shape at the TOP and per row; writes
without identifiers degrade as uncertain; tree walks carry visited sets and budgets; probes
answer True/False only on queryable payloads, None otherwise; never review names without
content; count markers at line starts; bound retained rail state. 15+5 fixes, 10 regression
pins, all red pre-fix.

## 50. Kernel locks beat breakable locks (2026-09-04, MECE round 7)
Terra reopened the CycleLock for the THIRD time: the O_EXCL + pid/age stale-breaking protocol had
a compare-then-unlink race that no amount of revalidation closes — two stale-breakers can
interleave so one unlinks the other's freshly-created LIVE lock and both cycles run. Fix: the
lock is now a kernel flock — no stale-breaking exists at all (the kernel releases on holder
death; no pid-reuse, no age math, no unlink), and the token is diagnostics only. Same desk
pass: omni aux fields (cursor/scanned/next_id/completion flags) were not normalized at load —
omni_cursor=1 TypeError'd the resume comparison and truthy "false" falsely terminalized lanes;
the ci_watch head string was trusted as a SHA and int(head[:6], 16) crashed fixes-enabled
cycles. Laws: locks that need 'breaking' are broken by design — prefer kernel-held locks;
normalize EVERY consumed aux field incl. bool-flags; never trust a forge head string as hex.

## 51. Credentials follow exact hosts; trees walk iteratively (2026-09-04, MECE round 7)
Sol's DOM-D pass: substring host matching let https://api.github.com.evil.invalid masquerade as
GitHub — the lookalike received the configured App token (adapter selection, diff-getter, auth
minting all keyed on substring); the CLI mirrored the minted GitHub token into EVERY unset
binding env including Forgejo mirrors (multi-forge token isolation); and the Forgejo tree walker
still recursed (deep acyclic trees hit the interpreter recursion limit before the call guard),
used a GLOBAL visited set that mistook shared content-addressed subtrees for cycles (files
silently omitted, omnisweep completion blocked forever), and validated neither the repo envelope
nor root blob rows. Laws: credentials route on EXACT normalized hostname equality; tokens never
cross forge transports; tree walks are iterative with ancestry-only cycle frames, per-sha caches,
fetch/push budgets, and one coerce-or-drop helper for every row.

## 52. Row containment before field access; watermarks normalize at the boundary (2026-09-04, MECE round 7)
DOM-B/E close: the own-PR merge scan read pr_data['number'] OUTSIDE the per-PR containment (one
malformed row killed the whole scan for later valid PRs); the issues lane read the persisted
watermark raw — a non-integer last_triaged_number TypeError'd the comparisons and the success
WRITE (max(int, 'bad')), and the F5-001 retry set silently broke across JSON persistence (ints
become strings; membership tests were in-memory-only); the fix-gate's configured-command argv
was cmd.split() (quoted paths with spaces corrupted); the runner dispatched due files
newline-delimited, so a newline-bearing config path split into two worker records. Laws:
containment wraps field ACCESS, not just operations; persisted counters normalize at the lane
boundary on READ and write back ints; argv construction uses shlex; dispatch is NUL-delimited.
4 regression pins, all red pre-fix.

## 53. Cleaned text scans; credentials refuse plaintext; weights must count (2026-09-04, MECE round 8)
Round-8 desk: envelope scanning ran on RAW content, so a model drafting JSON inside <think> plus
the real envelope tripped the ambiguous-duplicate refusal and lost the whole review; the GitHub
route accepted plaintext http://api.github.com and would have shipped the App token over the
wire; the readiness score's documented SCORING_CATEGORIES weights were dead data (a Major in an
8-weight category scored like one in a 36-weight category); omni persisted rows without id/line
KeyError'd complete publication; closed fix-depth PR records kept open_prs=True and blocked the
cold tier forever; the runner validated alert CONTAINERS but not alert ELEMENTS; and check-dirty
masked git failures as 'clean'. Laws: scan CLEANED text; credentials require https + exact host;
documented scoring data participates in scores; loader validation covers every later-consumed
field; tier activity reads an explicit open-id set, not retained history; containers AND
elements validate; git failures fail loudly.

## 54. Fix-lane integrity and marker ownership (2026-09-04, MECE round 8)
Sol's DOM-B close: base64 strictness rejected the API's line-wrapped content (disabling fixes);
untrusted tests ran in the SAME tree the bot commits from (hooks/target tampering could ride
into the commit); fix branches collided on rule-id-only names; the merge request never bound
GitHub's sha precondition (a force-push between check and merge merged an unverified head) and
legacy commit STATUSES were never queried (red status + green checks authorized merges);
configured pytest commands lost separate option values ('-c pyproject.toml' became '-c --');
non-Python changed tests fell back to a whole-suite attribution; chained-runner install errors
minted deterministic Criticals; ANY commenter could plant the public triage marker and
permanently suppress triage (watermark advanced over a foreign marker); label text with
embedded backticks broke code spans; calibration sliced raw lines instead of the last N model
calls and the append-only stream was read whole. Laws: validate whitespace-stripped payloads;
tests execute in .git-less copies and staged bytes re-verify; branches hash head+rule+path+line;
merges bind the checked SHA and both check-runs AND commit statuses; option arity survives argv
construction; unsupported test mappings return UNVERIFIED; setup failures are not test failures;
foreign markers quarantine without advancing; spans stay balanced; calibration counts events,
not lines; bounded tail reads.

## 55. Reasoning drafts are not reviews; nesting beats nearest-brace (2026-09-04, MECE round 9)
Sol's DOM-A pass: a model response containing ONLY a <think> block was certified as an empty
(clean) final review; a nested draft envelope beat the REAL top-level envelope because the
scan decoded from the NEAREST brace before each key (a nested object can own the nearest brace
without owning the key); file-mode (omnisweep) anchors accepted impossible line numbers (no
hunks => 'inside'); the credential-literal ceiling guarded only legacy rule 'secrets' while the
canonical capability is 'secrets-config'; negated clauses ('does not fail or crash',
'no credible scenario ... remote exploitation') counted as positive breakage evidence; and the
final parse diagnostic echoed raw model bytes (credentials into logs). Laws: reasoning blocks
never certify content; envelope decode picks the OUTERMOST object whose span contains the key;
whole-file anchors bound to real source length; severity gates cover the canonical rule family;
negation is clause-level and shared by contradiction/scenario gates; diagnostics redact.

## 56. Interrupted desks resume from artifacts, and arity tables rot (2026-09-04, MECE round 10)
The round-10 desk was interrupted mid-fix (family emergency; dirty tree + 2 red pins + a
dead session on a lane 502). Recovery worked from artifacts alone: git status (what was
dirty), the pytest lastfailed cache (what was red), the /tmp/fl4gauntlet round ledger +
round10-DOM-*.md recon outputs (what the round found), and the DSH session transcript tail
(what the session was doing at the cut). Two real lessons from the round itself: (1) hand
parsed pytest option tables rot — F8-006 was reopened TWICE in two rounds (-q swallowed the
suite path; -k lost its value); the cure is an explicit arity model that FAILS CLOSED to
UNVERIFIED on anything unmodeled, never a bigger table. (2) A second completion site leaks a
completion gate: omni rows_bad blocked the empty-pending path but not the same-cycle
finalize — a pin on the second site caught it. And one pin hygiene note: a regression pin
must FAIL pre-fix; two of the round's first pins passed on the unfixed tree (weak
discriminators) and were sharpened before close.

## 57. Round 11: the reopened-fix ratio peaked, and lenient-parse laws survive by scope (2026-09-04)
Round 11 (40 findings, ~2/3 reopened earlier fixes) is the exhaustion loop working as designed: the
audits now mostly re-find HALF-fixed classes. Three desk rulings worth keeping: (1) When two audit
laws conflict, scope by evidence — F11-A2 wanted unclosed <think> envelopes refused, but the UltraQA
round-2 law (live M3 output) parses them; the fix refuses only CLOSED think blocks whose envelope
lives inside the reasoning. Both pins stay green. (2) A "terminal" state is a product decision, not
an implementation detail: the deterministic-verify finding used to mark the SHA reviewed so the
deferred model analysis never ran (F6-C007 -> F11-C003 revision). (3) Completion gates must be
ATOMIC with their identity fields: load-state reconciliation that repairs one omni field at a time
left complete=True next to a lost cursor (F7-C002 -> F11-C008); one atomic sweep reset everywhere
(and one helper, used by every restart class) is cheaper than reasoning per field.

## 58. Round 12: the credential-cross-send class; config load is a security boundary (2026-09-04)
Three desk-carrying lessons: (1) ENV-NAMESPACE ISOLATION (F12-D005, critical): a forge binding's
token_env must never equal a model route's key_env — the app-installation token was mirrored into
binding env names, and one collision would have sent a forge credential as the model endpoint's
Bearer. Config load is a SECURITY boundary: namespace collisions, bool-coerced ints, URL
delimiters in repo ids, and netloc-less api_bases all validated fail-loud at load. (2) Privileged
git is an untrusted-surface sink (F12-B001): executed test code could write the shared sandbox
HOME's .gitconfig and steer the post-test commit/push; per-run disposable HOME + GIT_CONFIG_*
suppression + a write-tree/HEAD^{tree} equality belt closes the ride-along. (3) Incomplete
enumeration must RAISE, not return (F12-D002/B7): capped pagination returning a partial list as
complete is how watermarks advance past unseen issues and prune deletes live PR memory.

## 59. Round 13: three Criticals and the strongest reopen signal yet (2026-09-04)
Round 13 (45 findings, 3 Criticals) lessons: (1) CREDENTIAL NAMESPACES ARE A GRAPH,
NOT A PAIR (F13-B1/D1/A1): sandbox HOME reuse, cross-forge env duplication and
low-entropy assignment values were three different-looking holes in ONE invariant —
executed content must never influence what credential travels where, and 'credential'
must be defined by CONTEXT (password=...), not by entropy. (2) When a gate and a law
collide, scope by clause: the wide negation strip is right for contradiction/scenario
gates but wrong for failure-claim detection — claims need the NARROW negation rule
('never fail' refutes; 'never runs it ... failure' claims). The same scope-vs-law
discipline from #57 recurred. (3) Display transforms need injective encodings: every
round that mapped raw paths through a lossy display (redaction, newline→space, '→`)
created a reopen next round — control-escaping finally made lifecycle identity
byte-faithful.

## 60. Successor recovery: a deployed patch is not a closed finding (2026-09-04)

Round 14 had 39 findings and deployed code, but its ledger stopped at round 13
and the suite still had 605 passing cases. Exact reproductions plus independent
review reopened five fixes: unquoted path parsing, listing completeness,
numeric schema strictness, URL port validation and reversible credential-path
encoding. A sixth scheduler timestamp defect used a weaker parser than state.
The successor repairs have 45 new cases, 650 passed / 3 live skips, and scoped
independent approval. They remain local; round 14 and the 0/3 clean counter
are not closed. Evidence: docs/pm-recovery/RECOVERY-REPORT.md.

Enforce the contract at the common boundary: strict field validation at model
construction, rejected-row accounting before completion, and one canonical
timestamp validator. Public lifecycle keys must not encode credentials
reversibly. Preserve the source reproduction with each repair; commit messages
and old green tests cannot substitute for that evidence.

## 61. Optional corruption and uncertain remote identity (2026-09-05)

Fresh round 15 reopened optional fix flags: normalization was nested inside
the unrelated malformed-required-field branch. Normalize every retained row.
Persisted source lines also accepted booleans and nonpositive integers;
invalid evidence now resets sweep completion. Issue triage repeated the
review-comment identity bug: a malformed marker row looked absent and could
trigger a second comment. Uncertain identity now defers before model spend,
preserves retry membership, and cannot advance the watermark. Fifteen tests
cover restart-to-action behavior, malformed identities, and counterevidence.
The proposed unknown-severity crash was rejected: an existing membership
guard already prevents it. Independent review approved all three repairs.
Full suite: 665 passed, 3 live-model skips. Exhaustive clean rounds remain 0/3.

## 62. Verify the live evaluation and the published body (2026-09-05)

The opt-in model tests pointed at a unit-test endpoint. Once connected to
the configured real route, isolated cases passed but the full suite failed:
fleet-config tests leaked dummy credentials through os.environ.setdefault.
Use pytest's environment restoration, require explicit FL4WRITE_EVAL=1, and
load runtime credentials only for the live lane. The nested README check
also assumed some tests must be skipped; its parser now accepts zero skips.

The first real readiness sweep computed 77/100 but published no score in
its audit issue. End-to-end verification must inspect the delivered body,
not infer publication from a log. Complete audit bodies now include the
score and its evidence limitation. A report-version check refreshes old
completed issues once, without rescanning or fixing before publication
succeeds. Four behavioral cases pin complete/partial bodies and successful/
failed legacy refresh. The isolated release passes 672 tests with no skips,
including real model calls. This does not certify an exhaustive audit round.

## 63. Match repair and review boundaries to their actual work (2026-09-05)

Fresh round 18 found five defects despite a passing 841-test live suite.
Four repairs establish explicit boundaries: open-PR freshness checks use the
reviewed SHA; whole-file analysis accepts the complete supported 200000-byte
source instead of applying the 60000-character PR-diff cap; the public repair
operation owns and removes its temporary clones on every outcome; and owned
fix PRs are polled each enabled live cycle even when source reviews are cached.
Unsupported whole-file inputs defer before a model call. Regression cases
cover byte accounting, late-file findings, ordinary checkout failure, pending
CI and quiet subsequent cycles. Existing freshness fixtures now accept the
selected revision. The fifth finding, issue retries erased after incomplete
listing, remains open pending its real automated repair trial. Fresh green
rounds remain 0/3; these repairs do not establish certification.

Independent repair review caught two boundary regressions before delivery:
post-merge repairs still need default-branch freshness, and the normal merge
executor remains GitHub-only. Thread the post-merge mode into the freshness
choice and retain the primary-forge gate on the cycle drain. Two additional
real-cycle regressions reproduce the incorrect repaired behavior and pass
after these boundaries are restored.

The fifth repair subsequently landed at5452139: issue intake now carries
listing completeness, so absence only removes old retries after a complete
listing. Four real-cycle tests cover outage, malformed fallback, pagination
exhaustion and complete-empty cleanup; the first three preserve state through
recovery. Independent review passed333 neighboring tests. Full isolated live
validation passed858 tests with no skips and Ruff. The generated trial failed
before PR creation because its test forge never entered the fallback paths;
the separate manual repair does not count as automated lifecycle success.
Require regression fixtures to prove the intended failure path was executed,
not merely produce red assertions. Original failed artifacts remain intact.

## 64. Completeness includes row identity and executable behavior (2026-09-05)

Round19 found two defects after a green858-test live run. A valid list envelope
does not prove complete intake when row identities are malformed: retain the
direct caller's usable rows, but defer stateful processing until every identity
is known. Mixed valid/invalid listings must not advance the watermark past
unknown work. Twelve primary/fallback recovery cases pin this distinction.

Read-only test snapshots must preserve tracked executable behavior. Removing
write permission from a script should retain owner execute permission; ordinary
source files remain non-executable. A real tracked shell-helper invocation
reproduces the PermissionError that Python-only test entry points concealed.
Neither repair creates a fresh clean round or clears failed generated trials.

## 65. Preserve identities across presentation, publication and pagination (2026-09-05)

Round20 found three defects. A scrubbed path is display text, not a lossless
model-decision key: use collision-free aliases when formatting changes paths,
and map both keep and demotion decisions consistently. A clean rescan must
replace an existing findings report; publication is acknowledged only after
the update succeeds, with legacy state repaired and failures retried. Finally,
pagination must use the adapter's actual page-size parameter: Forgejo's limit
and GitHub's per_page are different contracts. Test a server that honors those
parameters and enough rows to force fallback, rather than counting invented
short fixture pages. Thirteen regressions cover these repairs.

## 66. Preserve source bytes through every repair stage (2026-09-05)

Literal Unicode paths and custom rule IDs need reversible handling wherever
they become presentation text or parsed identity. Round 21 also demonstrated
that a prepared patch is structured data, not a fresh model response. Passing
cached source through reasoning-text extraction changed literal source bytes
and broke repair replay. The same extraction damaged first-generation full
content and compact replacements. Decode complete JSON, remove only explicit
outer wrappers, and validate cached objects without reparsing their strings.
Test the same source through initial response and replay, including supported
wrappers. Green tests alone did not reveal the changed patch identity.

## 67. Bounded state must preserve discoverability and scope (2026-09-05)

A retry cap may bound stored IDs, but it cannot forget pending work behind a
watermark. Keep older pending identities and rewind before omitted ones so
ordinary collection finds the rest; verify actual recovery on the next cycle.
Shadow mode must not move that live boundary. The generated round22 repair
passed its live tests yet violated shadow preservation, so independent review
rejected it. Completed audits also need current scope evidence, not just an
unchanged HEAD. Validate the effective fingerprint before reusing completion,
and migrate unknown legacy scope through publication retry and a fresh audit.

## 68. Compare instants and preserve encoded identities (2026-09-05)

ISO timestamp strings do not sort chronologically across fractional precision
and timezone offsets. Filtering, ordering and cursor advancement must share
aware datetime comparisons, and persistence validation must accept the same
spellings as parsing. Test capped cycles and actual save/load, not just isolated
comparisons. Presentation identities also need one encoding boundary: a parsed
finding path is already encoded, so resolving it must reuse that identity.

## 69. Verify shell argument boundaries and persisted numeric overflow (2026-09-05)

Consume optional flags before assigning positional defaults. Preserve literal
filenames through both worker dispatch and result aggregation; a quoted write
does not protect a later unquoted read. Exercise the real shell fragment with
spaces, newlines and glob characters, including failed and missing results.
JSON numeric syntax can overflow the runtime float representation: persisted
counter normalization must reconcile integer-conversion overflow while keeping
valid review memory and counters.

## 70. Persist the work left at a deadline (2026-09-05)

Finishing a review does not imply its fixes were attempted. Check the deadline
at the review-to-fix boundary and before each new attempt; persist unattempted
findings against the reviewed SHA so a later cycle can resume without another
review or comment. Verify save/load and pruning between cycles. The same
lifecycle test matters for retry parks: normalizing only a local copy can
leave persisted values that pruning drops. Numeric identities need conversion
validation, not isdigit alone; include Unicode forms and conversion-size
limits in bounded-reconciliation tests.

## 71. Keep internal file identities exact (2026-09-05)

Grounded source paths are repair identities. Preserve them through recon,
sealed evidence and cached replay; sanitize presentation at its own boundary.
Git filename output needs NUL delimiters and byte-faithful decoding. Exercise
real repositories with Unicode, whitespace and newline-bearing filenames so
tests cover Git quoting and source hashing together.
