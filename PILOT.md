# The pilot program — 2026-08-31 launch snapshot (HISTORICAL; current state:
# README § Status + Session state below)

**32 repos** — 5 wave-1 org repos (kinocut, Epoch, devarch-framework,
Innerscape, Elixis) + 26 wave-2 repos (org + owner's personal; originally-ours
only, no forks/collabs; `voice-to-sculpture-app` removed — repo never existed
under that spelling; **liminal held** — Sinter's repo, #999 conversation, not
unilateral) + **KyaniteLabs/fl4write itself as #32 (2026-09-01, CEO CI-failure
directive: own-repo CI red summons review+fix — the bot dogfoods on its own
repo)**. Full product live: review + gatekeeper + metrics + **fix lane** +
**issues lane** (implementation live; opt-in per repo via `issues_enabled` —
no fleet repo has enabled it — README F3-004 doc truth; the pilot-day
"all four enabled" claim predates the opt-in reality) + **post-merge
review mode** (PM-2, 2026-09-01; fleet-enabled — reviews PRs merged since a
per-repo watermark, findings as post-merge comments, fixes as follow-up PRs —
the answer to this org's ~60s merges the open-PR poller never sees, LEARNINGS
#24) + **CI watch** (CEO directive 2026-09-01: red default-branch HEAD on an
own repo → findings from failing checks' annotations → fix-lane PR; no-fix →
escalation issue; SHA-keyed, never re-acts on the same head; own-repos only —
forks/upstream structurally out) + **retro audit** (CEO-approved live
2026-09-01: merged PRs BELOW the forward watermark, newest-first,
freshness-gated against zombie findings, cursor-resumable — kinocut first,
fleet after verification). Brain (TRANSITION):
today DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 via deepinfra (the $40-budget ledger route) —
**the CEO is building a local-inference floor with multiple models + a
consensus system** (2026-09-01); when it lands, the model routes in these
configs change and the fallback==primary warning becomes moot. Coordinate
with that lane before touching model routing. Identity:
`fl4write[bot]` (GitHub App, ID 3592379 — display name being re-cased to FL4WRITE by the CEO; per-repo installation
resolution across the org AND user-account installations).

## The runner (single-host law)

- **Host**: gpu-host `simon@100.113.174.74`, clone at `~/workspaces/fl4write`,
  crontab `0 * * * * ~/workspaces/fl4write/run-cycle.sh` (self-updating —
  pulls main first; model key read from `~/.bashrc`, quote-stripped).
- **Log**: `~/workspaces/fl4write/runner.log` — per-cycle summary line, ERR
  lines, and per-repo ALERT lines (adoption-lost etc.; surfaced 2026-09-01 —
  an "ok" status used to hide alerts).
- The zcode/laptop-hosted runner automation was RETIRED 2026-09-01: two
  hosts with independent state files = duplicate posts (LEARNINGS #17).
  One runner, one state dir. Do not re-add a second host.

## Monitoring (fl4write PM)

- **Telemetry** = the hourly runner.log line + `~/.fl4write/*.state.json`.
  A green cycle is the hourly aggregate (`~N ok / 0 errors` where N ≈ due
  repos this hour) with zero ALERT lines — the pilot-era `31 ok` constant
  died with fleet growth (F2-007 doc truth).
- **PM review cadence**: each session reads runner.log since last look;
  anything anomalous (crash loops, model_down persistence, double posts,
  ALERT repeats) files to the map (KyaniteLabs/.github #63) and
  BUG-SMELL-REGISTRY.md per empower-orchestrator law.
- **Acceptance metrics** (Greptile lesson): watch address-rate of posted
  findings per repo; a repo whose findings are never addressed = tuning
  conversation, not louder reviewing.
- **Racing-branch surveillance**: config-presence check every cycle. Six
  adoption losses across five repos so far (Innerscape ×1, Elixis ×2,
  devarch-framework ×1, tastecheck ×1, content-production-system ×1). An ALERT means: re-adopt on
  current main, then verify CONTENTS-ON-MAIN — never trust the merge event.

## Session state (2026-09-03, PM-3 day 1)

Fleet aligned to the forge of truth (CEO all-FJ order, Sep 2): six GH-era
shadow configs retired (kinocut, Epoch, Innerscape, checkyourself,
devarch-framework, Elixis — their FJ configs + FJ adoptions are live),
tastecheck + complyos + resonant-constable + resonant-context-kit
re-adopted on current mains, resonant-gifts in-repo config corrected
(wrong-target content survived inside the repo). 152→146 central configs;
repo-key uniqueness pinned (tests/test_fleet_configs.py). LEARNINGS #34.
Open: FJ fix-lane executor port (fix lane remains GitHub-only — v1 limit),
GH config re-add trigger = real GitHub PR flow returns.

PM-3 remediation (2026-09-03, CEO fix-all): 17 mirror-side GH central configs
retired (all-FJ; FJ twins live + adopted; zero GH PR flow on all 17 since
Sep 2) — fleet 146→129. ci_watch now mints findings only from file paths
(run-level annotations at the workflow dir are meta, not code — LEARNINGS
#36, adapter path_is_file). Fix-lane dir-anchor root cause closed: 9→10
attempts total, 0 landed, error class eliminated at the source.

PM-3 UltraQA adversarial pass (2026-09-03, later): the session wedged before
landing the gauntlet (harness route failures — LEARNINGS #37); the suite was
recovered from the session transcript and landed in the successor session:
9 adversarial tests over the dir-anchor class (hostile annotation paths
incl. traversal/unicode/empty, the adapter path_is_file file-or-directory
contract incl. 404 + transport fail-open + ref passthrough, the no-model-call
guarantee for unfetchable directories, annotations=None degrade) — 23
ciwatch tests green, 324 suite-wide.

Q1 calibration round 1 (2026-09-03, evening): first desk adjudication of the
posted-finding sample (CTO + CS consults, all code at reviewed SHAs) —
8/23 findings FALSE incl. 7/10 Criticals (self-contradictory bodies;
fabricated test-content premises); honest finding quality ≈9–30% vs the
posted-severity proxy of 55–85% (~3–6× overstated). LEARNINGS #38. Analyzer
gates landed: L1-B4 full-message self-contradiction gate + L1-B5
testing-quality Critical ceiling (verifiable failure claim + runnable
test_cmd required), 12 regression tests. Per-PR retractions posted on
liminal #1114–#1117/#1119/#1122 + one real missed defect filed (#1119 tempo
shim never runs for setContent pages). Q1 metric = adjudicated REAL share.

## Session state (2026-09-02, PM-2 day 2)

**CheckYourself integrated.** 19 capability-based review rules (auth, data,
secrets, API, testing, CI/CD, observability, performance, security, privacy)
merge into every config at load time. Readiness score (0-100, CheckYourself
caps) on omnisweep issues. Finding-level severity in telemetry. The analyzer
demands capability-grounded findings.

## Session state (2026-09-02, PM-2 day 1 close)

**Measurement mode.** Zero build debt (MECE six lanes + two delegate audits
absorbed to zero, 224+3 tests). Live from the 06:00 UTC cycle: severity
discipline (rubric x2 prompts + deterministic demotion + diff-anchored
literal verification), gatekeeper demote-mode, verify-tests (runs the diff's
own tests; deterministic Critical; never auto-patched), the un-deadened fix
lane (first real fix: Epoch #199), plus-ultra telemetry (~/.fl4write/
telemetry.jsonl — per-call tokens/latency/finish, gatekeeper decisions,
fix outcomes; route stats + calibration snapshot per cycle line). Quality
Loop = fl4write #5 (five CEO questions as falsifiable metrics, daily PM
reports). Reviewer quorum: MiniMax-M3 + Sol(codex) + mimo-v2.5-pro.
Watches: floor Qwen backend (lane re-downloading; fleet routes around it),
first organic verify/fix firing, CEO 20-finding weekly adjudication sample.
Issues-lane contract: ISSUES-BEHAVIOR.md.

## Pilot soak (HISTORICAL — the 14-day clock was superseded by the 2026-09-04
## fleet audit + MECE gauntlet read on fitness; see README Status + LEARNINGS)

Clock restarted 2026-09-01; criteria were 14 incident-free days OR 100
incident-free reviews — zero double-posts, zero email storms, model-route
stability, surveillance proven. Incidents (all fixed with regression tests):
the email storm (#17), the rename-sweep URL bug (#18), the app-slug identity
change (#20). Soak counts post-fix days; the fleet outgrew the clock (154+
repos, tier scheduler, MECE rounds 1-13) before it lapsed.

## Forgejo-only repos (approved 2026-09-01; SUPERSEDED 2026-09-02 by the CEO
## all-FJ order — configs landed on main and the fl4write bot identity is live;
## see Session state above. Section kept for history.)

Four repos exist ONLY on git.kyanitelabs.tech: `KyaniteLabs/achiote-icm`,
`simon/CNCL`, `simon/puenteworks-os`, `simon/rlenvs` (all originally-ours,
no forks/mirrors). Pipeline is built + live-proven in shadow (Gitea-native
PR listing, `.diff` endpoint, Forgejo-primary CLI path). BLOCKED on one CEO
click: a `fl4write` user on the host + token (site-admin; PM tokens are all
non-admin — probed). Configs staged in the PM clone (`*.forgejo.fl4write.yaml`),
HELD from main until the token exists (an authless config alerts every
cycle; posting under any interim identity violates the bot_login law).
v1 limits: fix lane + ci_watch are GitHub-only on Forgejo repos
(escalation-comment rail fires loudly); dual-homed repos' Forgejo-side PRs
uncovered (mirror machinery is the follow-up).

## Expansion beyond the pilot

Unchanged ladder (each gate before the next): acceptance metrics surfaced →
fix-lane first real fix verified → issues-lane behavior contract
(BEHAVIOR.md covers PR review only) → gatekeeper tuning from live data →
repo #32+. Adding a repo = a `<repo>.fl4write.yaml` in this repo + the
in-repo config (direct contents-PUT where allowed; **8 repos have rulesets
requiring PRs — PUT 409s; research-scout allows squash merges only**).
